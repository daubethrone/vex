This website was made for learning purposes, I have always loved flags and wanted to make it my first coding project available online.
It was made with python using the Flask framework, HTML/CSS was generated by the amazing Tailwind AI tool which I recommand you check out : https://www.tailwindai.dev/.
All of the data contained in the .json file comes from a bot that I did set up to scrap content from wikipedia (I did not code it myself).

I am aware that this is very messy and far from perfect but hey, it is my first one so I am pretty proud of it...
